# Santander MetGroup Paper Notebooks Repo


There is a growing concern among the scientific community about the lack of reproducibility of research (see for instance the dedicated [Nature Special Issue](https://www.nature.com/collections/wjsrmrdnsm)). With this regard, the main objective of this repository is to maintain a number of notebooks reproducing the analyses and figures presented in several [journal papers by the Santander Meteorology Group](http://www.meteo.unican.es/en/view/publications), with an special emphasis in those describing or exploiting the functionalities of the [climate4R framework](http://www.meteo.unican.es/climate4R). The purpose of these notebooks is twofold:

 1. To ease research reproducibility and scrutiny by the scientific community
 2. To aid users in the application of the `climate4R` tools and related software by means of worked examples representing true research problems.

An overview of the notebooks so far included and the corresponding published articles is next provided:
