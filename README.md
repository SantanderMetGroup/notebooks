# Santander MetGroup Paper Notebooks


There is a growing concern among the scientific community about the lack of reproducibility of many research outcomes (see for instance the dedicated [Nature Special Issue](https://www.nature.com/collections/wjsrmrdnsm)). In the specific case of Earth and Environment Science, a majority of papers were mostly (over two-thirds) not reproducible ([Baker, 2016](https://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970)).

With this regard, the main objective of this repository is to maintain a number of notebooks reproducing the analyses and figures presented in several [journal papers by the Santander Meteorology Group](http://www.meteo.unican.es/en/view/publications), with an special emphasis in those describing or exploiting the functionalities of the [climate4R framework](http://www.meteo.unican.es/climate4R). The purpose of these notebooks is twofold:

 1. To ease **research reproducibility** and scrutiny by the scientific community
 2. To aid users in the application of the `climate4R` tools and related software though the provision of **worked examples** representing real research problems.

An overview of the notebooks so far included and the corresponding published articles is next provided:

***
**NOTE**: The `climate4R` packages are being actively developed. Thus, the notebooks often indicate the installation of the package versions that were used at the moment of compiling them. Alternatively, there is usually a Session Information section at the end of each notebook with details on the package versions used to compile. As a result, example code may fail if run with different versions. If you experience problems while running some of the examples, **please ensure that you are using the appropriate package versions**. If the problem persists, just let us know by dropping a ticket in the Issues section of this repo. Thank you!
